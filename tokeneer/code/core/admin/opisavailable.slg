***  Proved C1:  loop__1__op = overridelock <-> prf_rolepresent(theadmin) =

     This was achieved by applying the rewrite rule admin_user(8)
     [from rulefile admin.rlu] to rewrite this conclusion to:
<S>  C1:  loop__1__op = overridelock <-> fld_rolepresent(theadmin) =

     This rule could be applied because its side-conditions hold, as follows:

     <<<  Immediate condition checktype(theadmin, t) evaluated successfully
