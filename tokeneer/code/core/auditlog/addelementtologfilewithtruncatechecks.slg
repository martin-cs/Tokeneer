***  Proved C5:  (fld_length(usedlogfiles) - 1) * 1024 + element(

     This was achieved by applying the inference rule 
          addelementtologfilewithtruncatechecks_user(2)
     [from rulefile addelementtologfilewithtruncatechecks.rlu] to infer this 
          conclusion from its side-conditions,
     which were established as follows:
     <<<  From H3, proved: element(logfileentries, [currentlogfile]) <= 1024
     <<<  By simple reasoning, proved: 1024 >= 0
     <<<  From H2, proved: element(logfileentries, [currentlogfile]) < 1024 or 
          fld_length(usedlogfiles) < 17
     <<<  From H21, proved: fld_length(usedlogfiles) <= 17
