***  Proved C1:  privatekeypresent(mk__optionalprivatekeyt(ispresent := true, 
          owner := theowner))
     This was achieved by applying the rewrite rule keystore_user(1)
     [from rulefile keystore.rlu] to rewrite this conclusion to:
<S>  C1:  fld_ispresent(mk__optionalprivatekeyt(ispresent := true, owner := 
          theowner))
     This rule could be applied because its side-condition holds, as follows:
     <<<  By simple reasoning, proved: fld_ispresent(mk__optionalprivatekeyt(
          ispresent := true, owner := theowner))

***  Proved C1:  privatekeypresent(mk__optionalprivatekeyt(ispresent := true,

     This was achieved by applying the rewrite rule keystore_user(1)

<S>  C1:  fld_ispresent(mk__optionalprivatekeyt(ispresent := true, owner :=

     This rule could be applied because its side-condition holds, as follows:

***  Proved C2:  not (added and not ispublic) -> (keystore__privatekeypresent(
          state) <-> keystore__privatekeypresent(state~))
     This was achieved by applying the inference rule addkey_user(1)
     [from rulefile addkey.rlu] to infer this conclusion from its 
          side-conditions,
     which were established as follows:
     <<<  From H33, proved: not (added and not ispublic) -> (privatekeypresent(
          fld_thistisinfo(state)) <-> privatekeypresent(thistisinfo~))
     <<<  From H5, proved: thistisinfo~ = fld_thistisinfo(state~)
***  Proved C1:  added and not ispublic -> keystore__privatekeypresent(state)
     This was achieved by applying the rewrite rule keystore_user(2)
     [from rulefile keystore.rlu] to rewrite this conclusion to:
<S>  C1:  added and not ispublic -> privatekeypresent(fld_thistisinfo(state))
     This rule could be applied because its side-condition holds, as follows:
     <<<  From H32, proved: added and not ispublic -> privatekeypresent(
          fld_thistisinfo(state))
